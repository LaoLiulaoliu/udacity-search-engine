This search engine is separated into two parts.
1. engine_spider.py
2. engine_search.py
We can crawl new things to enlarge the data, and search word without a crawling process.


engine_spider:
    Crawling web pages using thread pool model. At the same time, indexing all the words with crawled page. After crawling and indexing, based on all pages' outgoing link, compute every page's ranking.
    Dump the ranking and indexing variables into the hard disk.

engine_search:
    Load ranking and indexing variables from hard disk.
    Search the words or a sentence.
    Inputing words from the console, then stemming and searching.
    Showing the result in smart way.(quick sort and count the NO. of different word in one url)
    Caching the query result.
